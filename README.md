# Find-Repeating-Elements
### Task to find repeating elements in an array of size n

Steps:
* Define a function to identify any repeats in numbers based on those already present.
* Function checks if an element is present in the 'present' set.
* If it is, then it's classed as a duplicate and is added to the 'repeats' set.
* If not, the element is added to the 'present' set.
* Function then returns a list of duplicate elements found in the array.
